# Cave Of The Dead

My first ever game. Made with Game Maker 8.1. Take control of Mike Caver <s>(Who I named Jordan (after myself) in the game files. Even though it's not me o-o)</s> as he travels to the infamous cave of the dead to save his best friend.. Who doesn't have a name but you don't care.. Or do you?
